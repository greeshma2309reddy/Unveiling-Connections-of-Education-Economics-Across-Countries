# CSCE 5320 Final Project — End-to-End Data Analytics & Visualization

Welcome! 👋  
This project is part of my coursework for **CSCE 5320 - Data Analytics** at the University of North Texas. It showcases my ability to take a raw dataset, explore it, clean it, build predictive models, and communicate insights through interactive visualizations.

## 🔎 What This Project Covers

- ✅ Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- ✅ Feature Engineering  
- ✅ Supervised Machine Learning Models  
- ✅ Interactive Dashboards with Power BI  
- ✅ Clear Communication of Insights

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** — pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning** — classification models
- **Power BI** — dynamic dashboards for business users
- **Data Storytelling** — turning data into actionable insights

## 📂 Project Files

- `notebooks/CSCE5320PROJECTTHEFINALFINALFINAL.ipynb`:  
  My full analysis notebook — where I cleaned the data, explored patterns, engineered features, and built predictive models.

- `powerbi/CSCE5320FINALPROJECT.pbix`:  
  My Power BI dashboard — an interactive report that helps non-technical stakeholders quickly grasp the key findings.

- `images/`:  
  Screenshots of the Power BI dashboards (for a quick visual demo right here in the README).

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to design an end-to-end data analytics workflow
- How to integrate coding and visualization tools effectively
- How to build dashboards that help business users understand technical results
- The importance of feature engineering in improving model performance

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This project simulates a real-world data analytics pipeline:  
starting from raw data → cleaning → modeling → visualizing → communicating results to stakeholders.

If you're a recruiter or hiring manager:  
**this project reflects my ability to independently drive a full data analytics solution from start to finish.**
